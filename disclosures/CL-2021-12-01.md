Therefore, checking for infinity is crucial. py\_cc checks for infinity but the check is not accurate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [](https://github.com/ethereum/py_ecc/pull/107)[https://github.com/ethereum/py\_ecc/pull/107](https://github.com/ethereum/py_ecc/pull/107)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                      | 2020-11-13 | 2020-11-16 | 2021-12-01 |      | High     |                 | Quan                         | 5000                                                                                                      | 10000               |

So these messages, when put in a hash-set (backed by hashmap) will all go into the same bucket, but not get expanded into a subtree for O(log(n)) lookup performance as quickly.<br>The hashmap then resorts to JVM system-level hashcodes, after traversing the full depth of the tree.<br>From tests it appears that a 1 MB crafted gossip container can stall the gossip inbound-messages handler for about 4.5 seconds. This should run on the main gossip routine, thus make the node skip about 6-7 heartbeats.<br>                                                                                                                                                                   | [](https://notes.ethereum.org/MEFRmwGsT3ykoeSfSn21Ig)[https://notes.ethereum.org/MEFRmwGsT3ykoeSfSn21Ig](https://notes.ethereum.org/MEFRmwGsT3ykoeSfSn21Ig)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                      | 2020-12-03 |            | 2021-12-01 |      | Low      |                 | Proto                        | 1000                                                                                                      | 0                   |

So there is potential to amplify the other attacks by making messages 10 or 100 times as big.<br><br>A more basic attack, just as effective: send a 100 MB container, with about 100 million 1-byte empty messages. Each of these will have a heap object allocated (pointer, length, type) and get hashed (4 bytes cache + maybe 4 byte system hash in object header). And then referenced in a hashmap (another pointer or two at least). So assuming 1 byte = ~40 bytes memory, streaming a 100 MB malicious gossip can cause teku to bite in 4 GB worth of useless decoding and data, possibly enough for an OOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [](https://notes.ethereum.org/MEFRmwGsT3ykoeSfSn21Ig)[https://notes.ethereum.org/MEFRmwGsT3ykoeSfSn21Ig](https://notes.ethereum.org/MEFRmwGsT3ykoeSfSn21Ig)g                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                      | 2020-12-13 |            | 2021-12-01 |      | Medium   |                 | Proto                        | 6000                                                                                                      | 0                   |

Craft 100.000 streams, each with an open-frame (no title contents required) and a message frame. Totals around 8-10 MB. Each message must contain pro-active protocol negotiation, to avoid traffic back. And then send just the first bytes of the RPC contents: the length prefix. This opens 100.000 go routines, each allocating the length prefix (up to 1 MB due to lacking type based limiting), and stalling at least until decode timeout (at which point go routines clog the CPU and OOM is likely).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [https://gist.github.com/protolambda/c45a4d9167fc4b20f2f76c749eeb7105](https://gist.github.com/protolambda/c45a4d9167fc4b20f2f76c749eeb7105)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                      | 2021-02-12 |            | 2021-12-01 |      | Medium   |                 | Proto                        | 7000                                                                                                      | 0                   |
| Teku             | CL-2021-04 | Mplex unlimited open streams + decode problems, but saved by snappy-frame decoding edge-case                           | DoS        | Teku does not spawn many threads, but does allocate more per basic stream. Due to a snappy-frame decoding bug (if mplex frame is smaller than snappy frame), the payload is silently ignored, and it does not hang on it. But remove the protocol negotiation, and just spawn 100.000 (or many more) open streams, by just sending the create frames. Unsure if it works better with a 1 byte title per frame. Adds min. 2-3 GB of memory to running node, and makes JVM heap go jump up and down multiple gigabytes repeatedly for minutes on end per attack (giving GC a hard time too).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/3738](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/3738)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                      | 2021-02-12 | 2021-03-18 | 2021-12-01 |      | Medium   |                 | Proto                        |                                                                                                           |                     |

The function was a "no verify version" that would return a signature set for batch-verification outside of the function, but did not defer the state-root check in the same way. This makes the state-root effectively a graffiti field. The state-transition ignores the state-root when inserting the latest-header, but the block-root is still affected. This causes prysm to run into a bad block, store the resulting hot state with the bad block-root as key, and not find the state in the DB when someone builds a block with a parent-root based on the root of the latest-header of the latest state. The damage is limited because the chain cannot grow beyond one bad block, since the header-validation of the next block would fail against the state, which has a state-root in the header with deferred computation in the start of the next slot, which was still correct. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                      | 2021-04-07 |            | 2021-12-01 |      | Medium   |                 | Proto                        |                                                                                                           | 0                   |
